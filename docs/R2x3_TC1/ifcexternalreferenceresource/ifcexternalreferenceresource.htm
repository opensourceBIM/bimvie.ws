	 <P>The IfcExternalReferenceResource supports the reference to external
		sources of information. Currently three sources of external information are
		handled:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>Classifications</LI> 
		<LI>Documents</LI> 
		<LI>Libraries</LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>The following overview is given for those concepts separately.</P> 
	 <H2>Classification</H2> 
	 <H3>Introduction</H3> 
	 <P>The Classification model in IFC has developed progressively from its
		introduction within version 1.0 of the specification. Initially based on work
		undertaken for the ISO 10303 part 106 (Building Construction Core Model) in
		conjunction with ISO Technical Committee 59, it has been extensively
		redeveloped in conjunction with classification experts for use by the IFC 2x
		specifications.</P> 
	 <P>The Classification model in IFC recognizes that there are many different
		classification systems in use throughout the AEC/FM industry and that their use
		differs according to geographical location, industry discipline and other
		factors. For a generic model such as IFC, it is necessary to allow for the
		adoption of any rational classification system whether it be based on elements,
		work sections or any other classifiable division.</P> 
	 <P>The Classification model in IFC is able to represent classifications
		according to the most advanced current concepts from work in ISO, ICIS
		(International Construction Information Society) and EPIC (European Product
		Information Coding) as well as more traditional classifications such as those
		in the various SfB forms used internationally, CAWS, Masterformat etc.</P> 
	 <H3>Scope</H3> 
	 <P>The Classification model in IFC forms part of the
		<I>IfcExternalReferenceResource</I> schema and specifies the use of the
		independent resources necessary for the scope and information requirements for
		the exchange and sharing of classification information between application
		systems. Such information may be used at all stages of the life-cycle of a
		building</P> 
	 <P>The following are within the scope of this part of the
		specifications:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>The provision of one or more classification notations to an
		  object.</LI> 
		<LI>The inclusion of one or more facets to a classification
		  notation.</LI> 
		<LI>Referencing of facets of a classification notation from a described
		  source (classification item or classification table)</LI> 
		<LI>Exposure of the hierarchy of a classification structure.</LI> 
		<LI>Identification of the source of the classification.</LI> 
		<LI>The designation of a classification in terms of its source, edition
		  and name. </LI> 
		<LI>The provision of a means of semantically identifying the meaning of a
		  classification notation.</LI> 
		<LI>Referencing a classification held on an external source.</LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>The following are outside of the scope of this part of the
		specifications:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>The ability to translate from one classification notation to
		  another.</LI> 
	 </UL>

	 <H2>Documents</H2> 
	 <P>The IFC Documents Model enables reference to be made to documents stored
		externally to a populated IFC model or for information about documents to be
		stored within the model. </P> 
	 <H3>Scope</H3> 
	 <P>The scope of the IFC Documents Model is:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI> to manage reference to documents</LI> 
		<LI>to manage information about documents</LI> 
		<LI>to be equally applicable to documents that are paper based or stored
		  electronically</LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <P>The IFC Documents Model is not designed to be a complete document model
		and does not overlap in intent or content with such models. </P> 
	 <P>For details about such models, attention is drawn to the Document Object
		Model (DOM) issued by the World Wide Web Consortium which can be obtained from
		their web site at http://www.w3c.org.</P> 
	 <H4>Referencing External Documents</H4> 
	 <P>The IFC Documents Model considers that information may well be
		referenced from external sources. Reference a document is by its location
		(address) to enable access through mechanisms such as the World Wide Web. This
		is done through the IfcDocumentReference class. This is a type of
		IfcExternalReference that has a label (which can be the reference address) and
		identifier. Additionally, a name attribute provides the document with a human
		readable extension or qualifier to the location. </P> 
	 <P>Optionally, as well as the document reference itself, information
		concerning the document can also be stored as an attribute of the document
		reference. </P> 
	 <H4>Document Information</H4> 
	 <P>Information about a document (sometimes referred to as metadata) can be
		held using the <I>IfcDocumentInformation</I> class. This identifies and names
		the document, names the document owner and, optionally, can include a
		description of the document. Additionally, a revision identifier for the
		document may also be included.</P> 
	 <P>Document information can also include creation and revision times and
		the duration of its validity by reference to 'valid from' and 'valid to'
		attributes.</P> 
	 <P>For a document that is stored electronically, the
		<I>IfcElectronicDocumentFormat</I> class enables information about the format
		to be recorded. This includes the file extension used and information about the
		content using the MIME standard.</P> 
	 <H4>Document Information Relationships</H4> 
	 <P>Documents frequently hold references to information held in other
		documents e.g. documents referencing standards that are also documents. A
		significant tree structure of document information referencing could be built
		up in this way. Such relationships between document information can be captured
		through the <I>IfcDocumentInformationRelationship</I> class which manages both
		relating and related document information and inversely captures the document
		information carrying the pointer and the document information to which pointers
		refer.</P><HR SIZE="4" WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="CENTER" COLOR="#0000FF"> 
	 <H2>Library References</H2> 
	 <P>The ability to reference product information stored in external data
		libraries was introduced in IFC Release 2.0. In IFC 2x, the model has been
		further developed based on review and pilot testing of the model. This has
		resulted in moving the IFC Libraries Model from a being a subtype of
		IfcProperty to being a resource in its own right within the
		<I>IfcExternalReferenceResource</I> schema.</P> 
	 <P>The rationale of the IFC Libraries Model is that much of the information
		that will be used to populate a model exists in external data sources. While
		this can be brought into the model through objects and property sets, it may
		well be best to simply keep a reference to the location from where it can be
		obtained and leave it there. This has the potential advantage that, when
		required, the information from the library will be up to date having been
		maintained by the library provider. This may not be the case if the information
		is used to populate the model immediately.</P> 
	 <P>It also has the advantage that the volume of information within the
		model is kept to a minimum. For file exchange, this can be used effectively to
		delegate the actual acquisition of information to populate the model to the
		most appropriate source (providing they have access to the library referenced)
		rather than the first user having to acquire the information.</P> 
	 <H4>Scope</H4> 
	 <P>The scope of the IFC Libraries Model is to be able to reference
		information stored in external data libraries.</P> 
	 <P>The following are out of scope of the IFC Libraries Model:</P> 
	 <UL> 
		<LI>the format in which data are stored within the external data
		  source</LI> 
		<LI>the format in which data may be retrieved and transported from the
		  external data source to populate an IFC model.</LI> 
		<LI>the means by which transported information populates an IFC
		  model.</LI> 
	 </UL> 
	 <H4>Assumption</H4> 
	 <P>It is assumed that, most frequently, information will populate property
		sets within an IFC model and that many of these property sets will be defined
		outside of the formal development mechanisms of the IAI.</P> 
	 <P>Attention is drawn to the IfcPropertyResourceSchema and particularly to
		the IfcExtensionPropertySet class which has an optional LibraryReference
		attribute.</P> 
	 <H4>Library Referencing</H4> 
	 <P>As well as the IfcLibraryReference which contains a fully qualified
		location, reference and further qualification identifier (inherited from the
		IfcExternalReferenceResource class), the IfcLibraryInformation class specifies
		further detail about the library from which the information may be obtained.
		This includes the name of the library and optionally, its publisher, version
		number and version date.</P>
